## To-Do List React Project

Welcome to the To-Do List React Project! This is a simple and interactive to-do list application built with React. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed, helping to stay organized.

## Features
* Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list.
* Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed.
* Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, which visually distinguishes them from pending tasks.
* Persistent Data: The application saves tasks locally in the browser so that the list remains intact even after page refreshes.
* Responsive Design: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly, providing a great user experience on various screen sizes.
  
## Technologies Used
* React: For building the user interface and managing state with hooks.
* CSS: For styling the components and ensuring a responsive layout.
* JavaScript: For app logic and interaction.
* LocalStorage: For persisting tasks locally in the user's browser.

## How to Use
1. Add a Task: Type the task name in the input field and click "Add Task" to add a new task to the list.
2. Delete a Task: Click the "Delete" button next to any task to remove it from the list.
3. Mark a Task as Completed: Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks will be visually separated from active tasks.
4. Persist Data: The to-do list persists in your browser, so it remains even after you refresh the page.
   
## Components
* Task Input: A text input field where users can type new tasks.
* Task List: A list of tasks displayed with options to delete or mark them as completed.
* Task Item: A component representing an individual task with a checkbox to mark it as completed and a delete button.
  
## Future Improvements
* Task Editing: Allow users to edit their tasks instead of just deleting them.
* Prioritize Tasks: Add functionality to prioritize tasks by setting due dates or priority levels.
* User Authentication: Integrate user login for saving and syncing tasks across different devices.
* Backend Integration: Set up a backend API to store tasks and provide more advanced features like due dates and categories.
